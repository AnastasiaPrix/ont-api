## Summary
The attempt to befriend owl-api and apache-jena.
## Goal
The org.semanticweb.owlapi.model.OWLOntology object should have a reference to the org.apache.jena.graph.Graph.
The axioms adding must be reflected in the graph and vice verse - the adding a triplet must mean the adding of axiom.
## Next
Support of rdf:List axiom.
