/**
 * This is our analogue of {@link java.util.function.Function} which is used as an objects container with possibility to choose one of them depending on the input parameter.
 * For simplification code and to be able to change easily the default behaviour during the initialization of personalities.
 * <p>
 * Currently the are only two modes: {@link Mode#LAX} and {@link Mode#STRICT}.
 * The first one is a lax way. Any owl-entity could have more than one types simultaneously, there is no any restrictions.
 * The second one is to exclude so called 'illegal punnings' (property and class/datatype intersections) from consideration,
 * i.e. the interpretation of such things as owl-entity ({@link ru.avicomp.ontapi.jena.model.OntEntity}) is prohibited,
 * but they still can be treated as any other objects ({@link OntObject})
